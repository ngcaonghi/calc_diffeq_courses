## Tool for demonstrating autodifferentiation in computer algebra systems (in progress)
[Link to ./main/autodiff_toy in this repository](./autodiff_toy).

## Tool for clustering documents of similar topics
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JHF-CyewveylBSoc-OVseeux-4W7_c1k?usp=sharing)

For clustering students into group projects based on their statements of interest. The tool is based on variational autoencoder, which projects sparse vectors representing documents onto lower dimensions, and k-means clustering.
