# Toolkit and materials for courses in calculus and differential equations

This is an in-progress repository for tools and materials for a course in calculus and another in differential equations at Fulbright University Vietnam. A beta version of educational software for those courses is expected to be available in early October, 2021 (as a separate repository for easy installation). Course handouts will air in late August, 2021 here.
